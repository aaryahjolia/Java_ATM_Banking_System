2. Login – User can login through username and password they created when registering.
3. Deposit – User can deposit cash to their account after login, limit is 50k.
4. Withdraw – User can withdraw cash from their own account after login.
5. View details – User can view their complete details.
6. Transaction history – User can see their history of cash transfers with date, day & time also.
7. Transfer to another account – User can transfer money to other account, if it exists.
